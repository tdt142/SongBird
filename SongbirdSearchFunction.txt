1. User will input string s1 into the search bar.
	s1 = "Take Me Home, Country Roads"

2. s1 has all nonalphanumeric characters and non-spaces are removed.
	s1 = "Take Me Home Country Roads"

3. The database will be binary searched starting with the leftmost character of s1 and moving rightward.
Song titles that have the most matching characters will be prioritized in the search. The comparison will be
case insensitive.

The first n slots will be filled with results that closely match s1 character by character.

4. s1 will be parsed into individual words along the spaces in the string. The words will become a list.

s1 = [Take, Me, Home, Country, Roads]

5. The song titles with the most words that match the words in the list will be ranked the highest.
Keyword tags associated with songs will increase this ranking.

6. Take the top results as hypertext links and output them to a list.
print the list in a vertical column as the results of the search.
